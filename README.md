# Getting Started

First, install the dependencies (use --legacy-peer-deps as using Next.js 15 + React 19):

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

Then you need to create an **.env.local** file in the root of the project with the following values populated from your sanity studio:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID="the-project-id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET="the-dataset-to-target"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_STUDIO_URL="sanity-studio-url"
SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN="read-token"
```

Using sanity cli you can upload the **production.tar.gz** dataset which has the sample data:

```bash
sanity dataset import [file-name] [the-dataset-to-target]
```

Then to run the project type

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
Open [http://localhost:3000/studio](http://localhost:3000/studio) to use the Sanity embedded studio.
